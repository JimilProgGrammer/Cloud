#  MeghNA Cloud Detection Algorithms
This branch maintains code for all algorithms tried for the cloud detection problem.
## Mask RCNN

We have tried cloud detection in satellite imagery with the Mask RCNN algorithm.The images used for training the model were provided by **ISRO**. The data-set consists of captures from the **INSAT 3-D** satellite.
For the purpose of training the model,we first manually annotated the part of images containing cloud portions.

#### Results:

##### Satellite Image
