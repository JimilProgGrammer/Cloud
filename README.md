# MeghNA Cloud Motion Prediction

This branch maintains all code for algorithms used to predict cloud motion.

## KNN + Naive Method

This is a naive method for motion prediction where based on Centre Of Mass (COM) movement in the last two images, the direction and speed of cloud movement is calculated. This method is in continuation from the KNN detection algorithm and takes the KNN output CSVs as input.
